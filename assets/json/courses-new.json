Diversity is about representation or the make-up of an entity. Inclusion is about how well the contributions, presence, and perspectives of different groups of people are valued and integrated into an environment (Matt Bush 2021). This means that an environment where many different genders, races, nationalities, and sexual orientations and identities are present but only the perspectives of certain groups are valued or carry any authority or influence, may be diverse, but it is not inclusive.</p>\n<p>A diverse and inclusive workplace is one that makes everyone, regardless of who they are or what they do for the business, feel equally involved in and supported in all areas of the workplace.</p>\n<p>Do you have diversity in your&nbsp;recruitment policy, in each of your departments, and in your leadership ? Or do you have a workplace where 50% of your employees are women but 0% of your women are managers ? Do you have good representation of employees of color overall, but all of them are in the same department ? These questions reveal true diversity and inclusion in the workplace.</p></div>",

Celles-ci comprennent les compétences inférentielles, les compétences évaluatives, les compétences en résolution de problèmes, les compétences analytiques, les compétences en compréhension et les compétences cognitives.",
          "overview": "Huitt William (1998) defines critical thinking as the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analysing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication to guide the development of beliefs and taking of action. McPeck (as cited Garret, 2009: 8) in a simpler way however, defines critical thinking as the propensity and skill to engage in an activity with reflective skepticism.",
          "objectives": "This module aims at equipping participants with knowledge and skills in critical thinking ",
          "approach": "By the end of this module, participants should be able to apply - inferential critical thinking skills-  evaluative critical thinking skills-  problem solving critical thinking skills- analytical critical thinking skills- And lastly, cognition critical thinking skills",

Women may identify safe water, food, health care, cash income, as immediate interests/needs that they must meet.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic </strong><strong>needs</strong> on the other hand are the long-term and aim to address the root of their subordinate gender position and ultimately change gender norms. They relate to issues of power and control, and to exploitation under the sexual division of labour. Strategic interests/needs may include legal rights, an end to domestic violence, equal wages and women’s control over their own bodies.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts </strong><strong>9, 10 &amp; 11 </strong><strong>: </strong><a><strong>The Women Triple Roles</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Gender analysis recognizes that women’s needs differ from men’s needs because of the triple role women play, as well as their subordinate position to men in society. When analysing needs of women and men, gender analysis makes distinction in the triple roles women and men play in the society and household. These include<strong> productive work, reproductive work and community roles.</strong> <strong>Productive work/roles :</strong> This is work that produces goods and services for consumption by the household or for income and is performed by both men and women. Women’s productive work is often less visible and less valued than men’s productive work.</li><li><strong>Reproductive work/roles :</strong> This work involves the bearing and rearing of children and all the tasks associated with domestic work and the maintenance of all household members.&nbsp; These tasks include cooking, washing clothes, cleaning, collecting water and fuel, caring for the sick and elderly.&nbsp; Women and girls are mainly responsible for this work which is usually unpaid.</li><li><strong>Community work/roles :</strong> Women’s community roles include provisioning and maintenance of resources which are used by everyone, such as water, healthcare, education.&nbsp; These activities are undertaken as an extension of their reproductive role and are normally unpaid and.&nbsp; In contrast it is mainly men who are involved in politics at the community level.&nbsp; This work may be paid or unpaid but can increase men’s status in the community</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Concepts 12 &amp;13&nbsp;:</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>D</strong><strong>iversity &amp; </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>nclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Diversity and inclusion are two interconnected concepts—but they are far from interchangeable. Diversity is about representation or the make-up of an entity. Inclusion is about how well the contributions, presence, and perspectives of different groups of people are valued and integrated into an environment (Matt Bush 2021). This means that an environment where many different genders, races, nationalities, and sexual orientations and identities are present but only the perspectives of certain groups are valued or carry any authority or influence, may be diverse, but it is not inclusive.</p>\n<p>A diverse and inclusive workplace is one that makes everyone, regardless of who they are or what they do for the business, feel equally involved in and supported in all areas of the workplace.</p>\n<p>Do you have diversity in your&nbsp;recruitment policy, in each of your departments, and in your leadership ? Or do you have a workplace where 50% of your employees are women but 0% of your women are managers ? Do you have good representation of employees of color overall, but all of them are in the same department ? These questions reveal true diversity and inclusion in the workplace.</p></div>",
